\title{Plot Segmented or Stegmented Model Results}
\usage{
plot_ss(
  result,
  data,
  formula.1,
  formula.2,
  model.type = "segmented",
  plot.type = "both",
  n_points = 100,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{The output from a segmented or stegmented model fitting function,
containing thresholds, the fitted model, and log-likelihood information.}

\item{data}{The original dataset used for model fitting.}

\item{formula.1}{The formula for the linear part of the model.}

\item{formula.2}{The formula specifying the change point variable.}

\item{model.type}{A string indicating the type of model: "segmented" (default) or "stegmented".}

\item{plot.type}{A string specifying which plot(s) to produce: "fit", "loglik", or "both" (default).}

\item{n_points}{The number of points to use for generating the smooth fitted line (default is 100).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
Depending on the \code{plot.type} argument, the function returns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"fit"}: A plot of the data with the fitted model.
\item \code{"loglik"}: A plot of the log-likelihood surface or summary.
\item \code{"both"}: Both the fit and log-likelihood plots arranged side by side using \code{grid.arrange}.
}
}
\description{
Visualizes the results of segmented or stegmented regression models, including
the data with the fitted model and/or the log-likelihood surface for the thresholds.
}
\details{
This function leverages the \code{ggplot2} package for creating plots and the \code{gridExtra}
package for arranging multiple plots. It adapts its visualization based on the number
of thresholds in the model:
\itemize{
\item \strong{One threshold}: Plots the log-likelihood against the threshold value.
\item \strong{Two thresholds}: Generates a heatmap of the log-likelihood surface.
\item \strong{More than two thresholds}: Displays a text summary of the best thresholds and
their corresponding log-likelihood.
}

\examples{
# Example with a segmented model
# Assuming 'result_seg' is the model output and 'data' is the dataset
# plot_ss(result_seg, data, formula.1 = y ~ x, formula.2 = ~ x,
#         model.type = "segmented", plot.type = "both")

# Example with a stegmented model
# plot_ss(result_steg, data, formula.1 = y ~ x, formula.2 = ~ x,
#         model.type = "stegmented", plot.type = "fit")
