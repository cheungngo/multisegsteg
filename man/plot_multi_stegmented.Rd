\title{Plot the results of a multi-stegmented regression model}
\usage{
plot_multi_stegmented(
  result,
  data,
  formula.1,
  formula.2,
  plot.type = "both",
  n_points = 100,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{List. Output from the multi_stegmented function.}

\item{data}{Data frame. The original dataset used to fit the model.}

\item{formula.1}{Formula. The same formula.1 used in the multi_stegmented function.}

\item{formula.2}{Formula. The same formula.2 used in the multi_stegmented function.}

\item{plot.type}{Character. Type of plot to create:
- "both" (default): Creates both the fit plot and log-likelihood plot
- "fit": Creates only the fit plot with data points and fitted line
- "loglik": Creates only the log-likelihood plot}

\item{n_points}{Integer. Number of points to use for generating the smooth fitted line.
Higher values create a smoother curve. Default is 100.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to ggplot functions.}
}
\value{
If plot.type = "both", returns a grid of plots arranged using gridExtra.
If plot.type = "fit" or "loglik", returns a single ggplot object.

\description{
Creates visualizations for interpreting multi-stegmented regression models,
displaying both the fitted stegmented line (with discontinuities and slope changes)
and the log-likelihood surface or profile. For models with one threshold, the function
shows a profile of log-likelihood values. For models with two thresholds, it displays
a heatmap of the log-likelihood surface.
}
\details{
This function generates two types of plots:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Fit Plot}: Shows the original data points and the fitted stegmented regression line,
with vertical dashed lines indicating the estimated threshold locations. The plot
illustrates both the discontinuities (steps) and changes in slope at each threshold.
\item \strong{Log-likelihood Plot}:
\itemize{
\item For one threshold: Shows a profile of log-likelihood values across all candidate
threshold values, with the optimal threshold marked.
\item For two thresholds: Displays a heatmap of the log-likelihood surface across
all combinations of threshold values, with the optimal combination marked.
\item For more than two thresholds: Provides a text summary of the optimal thresholds
and their log-likelihood value.
}
}

The stegmented model differs from the standard segmented model by allowing
discontinuities at the threshold points in addition to changes in slope.

\examples{

# Generate example data with both steps and slope changes
set.seed(123)
n <- 200
x <- runif(n, 0, 10)
z <- rnorm(n)
# Data with steps at x=3 and x=7, and changes in slope at the same points
y <- 1 + 0.5 * z + 0 * x + 2 * (x > 3) + 1 * pmax(x - 3, 0) +
     3 * (x > 7) + 2 * pmax(x - 7, 0) + rnorm(n)
data <- data.frame(y = y, x = x, z = z)

# Fit stegmented model with two thresholds
result <- multi_stegmented(
  formula.1 = y ~ z,
  formula.2 = ~ x,
  family = "gaussian",
  data = data,
  n_thresholds = 2
)

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Plot both the fitted line and log-likelihood surface
plot_multi_stegmented(result, data, formula.1 = y ~ z, formula.2 = ~ x)

# Plot only the fitted line
