Description: Implements methods for fitting and visualizing segmented regression models 
    with multiple thresholds. The package provides two primary types of change-point 
    regression models: (1) Multi-segmented regression with continuous piecewise linear 
    relationships that change slope at one or more thresholds while maintaining continuity,
    and (2) Multi-stegmented regression that allows both discontinuities (steps) and 
    slope changes at the threshold points. The package enables identification of optimal 
    threshold locations through grid search based on likelihood maximization, supports 
    both continuous (Gaussian) and binary (logistic) outcomes, provides cluster-robust 
    standard errors for correlated data, and includes comprehensive visualization tools 
    for model interpretation.
